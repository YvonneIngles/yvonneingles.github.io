            <h4>What is the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to prevent growth in vitro for 16 different bacterias?
                </h4>
            <div id="firstViz"></div>
            <div class="description">
                The visual encodings that I used are: position, length, and color. The position of the bars, such as the way that they are grouped
                together indicate which bars correspond to which bacteria has what concentration of antibiotics. The length of the bars indicate
                the value of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) that is needed for each antibiotic to prevent growth in vitro for a bacteria.
                The colors of the bars represent which antibiotic is being encoded. The raw data was normalized by a Log10(x)+3 scale. This was done 
                because the values had a large range between them (0.001 - 870 MIC).

                The y-axis is scaled incrementally by 1 to simplify the amount of visual information along the axis. The labels along the x-axis are
                angled for better readibility. The legend in the top right indicates what the colors of the bars mean.
            </div>
            <h4>What are the results of a gram staining test on the bacteria?</h4>
            <div id="secondViz"></div>
            <div class="description">
                The visual encodings that I used are: position and color. The position of the circles indicate what the result of the gram staining
                test was on the bacteria. Color was used to encode a positive reading (green) and a negative reading (red).

                The y-axis has labels to further indicate whether the gram staining was positive or negative for the pertaining bacteria. The height
                of the graph was set to 300px to decrease the white space betwen the circles. This lessens how much the viewers eyes have to travel
                to see which circle represents the result of the corresponding bacteria.
            </div>
            <h4>Which antibiotic is most effective against bacteria when considering its MIC?</h4>
            <div id="thirdViz"></div>
            <div class="description">
                The visual encodings that I used are: position, color and size. The position of the circles indicate the MIC value of the antibiotic
                needed. Color was used to encode the antibiotic name. The circle sizes were encoded with the MIC value for the corresponding bacteria.
                The smaller the circle size the less MIC needed to prevent in vitro growth of the bacteria.

                The graph has grid lines to make it easier to see where the circles are positioned. This makes it easier to identify the MIC and the
                bacteria that pertains to a specific circle. Like the previous graphs, the x-axis labels are angled for readiblity and the legend
                indicates the antibiotic name and color.
